- Through data analysis, I have removed attributes which are not required for the classification of player position.  E.g. player name, age, time, game, game started. In addition to that, minutes played per game is not representative for every player.
- Feature selection helped to removed interdependent attributes.
- Standardization techniques are applied to understand the distribution of the data.
- Parameter tuning helped to train the classifier model for the given dataset in efficient way.
- SVM classifier tends to avoid overfitting but, the use of cross validation helped to evaluate the model built for classification of the NBA player dataset.
